# Text Data Explorer

Text Data Explorer is a Python application designed for text analysis and exploration, with support for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as translation, transliteration, and Named Entity Recognition (NER). It provides a user-friendly interface for analyzing multilingual text data and evaluating machine learning models.

## Features

- **Translation Module:** Analyze and evaluate machine translation quality using metrics such as BLEU score, ChrF++, and LABSE score across multiple languages.
- **Transliteration Module:** Compute accuracy, Levenshtein distance, Jaccard similarity, and character error rate for transliteration tasks in different languages.
- **NER Module:** Perform Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks and evaluate model performance using precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy metrics.
